# Code Complete

- `In the day-to-day rush of grinding out the latest project, however, few experts take the time to share what they have learned`
  - importance of blogging right after you solve a problem/ complete a project 
- the source code is the only accurate description of the software & often the code itself is the only documentation available to programmers (all other docs go out of date)
  - importance of making the source code readable & understandable
- An algorithm gives you the instructions directly. A heuristic tells you how to discover the instructions for yourself, or at least where to look for them.
- knowing how to approach problems in general is at least as valuable as knowing specific solutions for specific problems
- incremental development, you first make the simplest possible version of the system that will run. It doesn’t have to accept realistic input, it doesn’t have to perform realistic manipulations on data, it doesn’t have to produce realistic output—it just has to be a skeleton strong enough to hold the real system as it’s developed. It might call dummy classes for each of the basic functions you have identified.
- If you’re building a simple structure—a doghouse, say—you can drive to the lumber store and buy some wood and nails. By the end of the afternoon, you’ll have a new house for Fido. If you forget to provide for a door, as shown in Figure 2-3, or make some other mistake, it’s not a big problem; you can fix it or even start over from the beginning. All you’ve wasted is part of an afternoon. This loose approach is appropriate for small software projects too. If you use the wrong design for 1000 lines of code, you can refactor or start over completely without losing much.
- Systems: greater complexity and size imply greater consequences in both activities - any changes at more advanced stages require more time by a broader array of people
- Plan enough so lack of planning doesn’t create major problems later.
- in software you might generally use flexible, lightweight development approaches, but sometimes you’ll need rigid, heavyweight approaches to achieve safety goals and other goals
- To move a wall six inches costs more if the wall is load-bearing than if it’s merely a partition between rooms. Similarly, making structural changes in a program costs more than adding or deleting peripheral features.
- the construction analogy provides insight into extremely large software projects. Because the penalty for failure in an extremely large structure is severe, the structure has to be over-engineered
- The more you learn about programming, the more you fill your mental toolbox with analytical tools and the knowledge of when to use them and how to use them correctly
- A common cause of incomplete preparation is that the developers who are assigned to work on the upstream (preparation) activities do not have the expertise to carry out their assignments. The skills needed to plan a project, create a compelling business case, develop comprehensive and accurate requirements, and create high-quality architectures are far from trivial, but most developers have not received training in how to perform these activities.
- In general, the principle is to find an error as close as possible to the time at which it was introduced. The longer the defect stays in the software food chain, the more damage it causes further down the chain
